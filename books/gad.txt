        GAD

        40. (a) Why was Jacob’s seventh son named Gad? (b) In his final words, of what did Jacob seemingly speak
        concerning Gad?

        40 Jacob’s seventh son was named Gad, but was the son of his concubine Zilpah, her first son. His name is
        understood to mean “Good Fortune.” That is what Leah took it to be when her handmaid Zilpah bore this son as
        another contribution to her husband Jacob from her side of his household, since Leah craved the love of her
        husband. (Gen. 30:9-11) When dying Jacob said his final words over Gad, he seemingly spoke of the exposed
        location that the tribe of Gad would occupy in the land of Israel. It was along the eastern shore of the Jordan
        River and was therefore exposed to invasion by the unfriendly Ammonites to the east. But this was the territory
        that the tribe of Gad, as livestock raisers, asked for themselves before the Israelites crossed the Jordan River
        into the Promised Land. (Num. 32:1-5; 34:13-15) Quite appropriately Jacob prophesied:

        “As for Gad, a marauder band will raid him, but he will raid the extreme rear.”—Gen. 49:19.

        41, 42. When coming into their possession, how did the tribe of Gad show they were not a tribe of cowards?

        41 Gad was to show himself not a tribe of cowards, afraid to have one side of his boundary open to marauder
        bands. The tribe did not choose to live on the eastern highlands just to get out of fighting for the land of
        Canaan. In obedience to God’s will they sent along their quota of fighters across the Jordan to help their
        fellow tribesmen to gain possession of the Promised Land. No sin of failure caught up with them in this respect.
        (Num. 32:6-36; Josh. 4:12, 13; 13:24-28; 22:1-9) To that end they kept in good fighting form, and fought
        shoulder to shoulder with their brothers.

        42 Jacob’s parting words to Gad were as a command for him to strike back confidently at those marauding him and
        violating his borders. Doubtless in the days of Judge Jephthah they fought under him against the aggressive
        Ammonites, who laid claim to the land. They benefited from Judge Jephthah’s defeat of those border enemies.
        They, in turn, raided the raiders, making these turn about in flight and pursuing their extreme rear. (Judg.
        11:1-33) When the test came to execute a fleeing remnant of men who had rebelled and stirred up strife and
        fought against their brothers, the warriors of the tribe of Gad were able to pronounce the password “Shibboleth”
        correctly. So they did not fall in death by the sword of execution.—Judg. 12:1-6.

        43. What place did Gad find in Ezekiel’s vision of the division of the land and in John’s vision of spiritual
        Israel?

        43 In Ezekiel’s vision of the division of the land, the territory of Gad was again left open, on its south side,
        for it was the southernmost territory in the assignments to the tribes. Gad was thus twelfth in order. But in
        the order of the gates of the city Jehovah-shammah, the gate for Gad was tenth. (Ezek. 48:27, 28, 34) The tribe
        of Gad was also honored with third mention in the list of the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel, for in Gad
        there were qualities good also for spiritual Israelites to have.—Rev. 7:5.
